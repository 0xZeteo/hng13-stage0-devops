A short project description: I set up and configured a live NGINX web server on AWS EC2 as part of the HNG13 Stage 0 DevOps challenge. This involved launching a cloud VM, editing the default HTML page with my unique identifiers, and ensuring the website is publicly accessible for review. The project showcases my ability to manage cloud resources and automate server setup using practical DevOps tools and workflows.
